# Blockchain_Crypto
This Repository is to demonstrate the work completeted, showcases the skills and knowledege gained through this directed study and personal research. I developed a blockchain and cryptocurrency from scratch using Python and test-driven development in an instructor-guided Udemy course. My almost-working code incorporates fundamental components required for developing a  working cryptocurrency. These concepts include digitally signing and verifying signatures, designing a tamper-proof blockchain that can store any kind of data, securing the blockchain with the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, communicating transactions with block users through sockets (client-server), and fashioning a wallet and miner for the coin. I track my development and learning progress in each of the section folders. The second part of this directed study includes a comprehensive overview of relevant consensus mechanisms used in cryptocurrencies today and can be viewed in the GitHub repository as well. Lastly, in the Blockchain Consensus Algorithms folder, viewers can find the course completion certificate and a schedule that summarizes the work completed along the way.
