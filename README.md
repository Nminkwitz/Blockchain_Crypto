# Blockchain_Crypto
This Repository is to demonstrate the work completeted as well as showcase skills and knowledege gained through my research. I developed a blockchain and cryptocurrency from scratch using Python in an instructor-guided Udemy course. My almost-working code incorporates fundamental components required for developing a  working cryptocurrency. These concepts include digitally signing and verifying signatures, designing a tamper-proof blockchain that can store any kind of data, securing the blockchain with the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, communicating transactions with block users through sockets (client-server), and fashioning a wallet and miner for the coin. The second part of this directed study includes a comprehensive overview of the most relevant consensus mechanisms used in cryptocurrencies today and can be viewed in the GitHub repository.
